# Typo-Generator-3000
Great for procrastinating during work hours and possibly jeopardizing your job.

# Usage
Here is an example usage for this glorious code written by divine intervention and wisdom:

    python3 typogenrec5000-no-ui.py -m"If ELon Musk was a wold I'd be a furry" -l 3 -f 0.05 -r 0.5 | cowsay    
  
Where:

 - -m is your message to be translated to a language not yet understood by mere mortals,
 -  -l is loopy boi, amount of times typogen is applied recursively,
 -  -f is failrate (float between 0 and 1), the probability that the one above all conclude that that character is worthy of changing
  - -r is the random rate (float between 0 and 1), the probability that a supreme gift is added between the words of your message

If you don't pipe it to `cowsay` you are not doing it right.
